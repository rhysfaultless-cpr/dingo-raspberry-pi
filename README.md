<img src="/images/dingo-raspberry-pi-1.png" alt="Image of dingo and pi" width="600" >

Dingo is an indoor mobile robot that can be configured for differential-drive, or omnidrirectional-drive.
You can find more information about Dingo at the  website [Clearpath Robotics](https://clearpathrobotics.com/dingo-indoor-mobile-robot/).


## Hardware overview

We mounted the Raspberry Pi 4 on the outside of the Dingo.
We conisdered this an advantage for the applications that want a low cost computer for Dingo.
The external mounting improves the Pi's WiFi signal, and gives quick access to the Pi's microSD card.


## Tools needed

You will need these tools:

* To make the Pi's power cable
  * Wire stripper
  * Wire cutter
  * Crimper for Molex mini-fit-jr, 18 AWG crimps
  * Heat gun, for heat shrink tubing

* To attach the Pi to the Dingo
  * Hex key, 3 mm across flats
  * side cutters / flush cutters, for cable-ties
